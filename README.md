# CursedTF2
A mod for Team Fortress 2 that makes the game incredibly cursed by adding a bunch of random stuff.
This mod will most likely be unbalanced to all hell so...... sorry I guess?

## Planned features
- Increase map size from 32767^3 hammer units to some ridiculously large number^3
- Increase max players from 32 to 128 (and higher if the game won't have major issues)
- 4 teams for certain maps just like in TF2 Classic (allowing for 32v32v32v32 battles for example)
- A lot of cursed weapons
- Vehicles. You read that right. Vehicles
- A bunch of new taunts
- Custom playermodels maybe?
- Might improve some stuff in general regarding performance and networking but no promises here
- New maps designed around the changes above
- And a bunch of more shit I can't think of right now

## Note
This uses leaked source code, so if anyone from Valve sees this and wants me to take the project down, I will comply
